                Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.

            Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. It doesn't look so shiny to me.

            Fatal.
            No argument here.
            When will that be?
            Bender, quit destroying the universe! Actually, that's still true. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

                Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! 
                NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Tell her she looks thin. That's not soon enough! That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? You can see how I lived before I met you. And yet you haven't said what 
                I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. File 
                not found. You know the worst thing about being a slave?

                They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Shut up and take my money! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult 
                stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. That's not soon enough! Actually, that's still true. Belligerent and numerous. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! 
                Cause explosive decompression! Shinier than yours, meatbag. And then the battle's not so bad?
