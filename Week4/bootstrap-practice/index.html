                <p>My name is Merely Ducard but I speak for Ra's al Ghul... a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld. A mon who can offer you a path. Someone like you is only here by choice. 
                You have been exploring the criminal fraternity but whatever your original intentions you have to become truly lost. The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil and wishes to serve true justice. 
                The path of the League of Shadows. How about a magic trick? I'm gonna make this pencil disappear. Ta-da! Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. 
                Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair.
                </p>

                <h3>No, I'm Heading</h3>
                <p>Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, 
                many have died trying. And then here there can be no true despair without hope. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you 
                can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you've truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny. We will 
                destroy Gotham. And then, when that is done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission to die.

                <h3>Why Are Mommy and Daddy Always Fighting?</h3>
                <p>But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangIing the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had 
                never existed so you'd be spared your pain. Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this 
                is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?
